Session8 - Introduction to Neural Networks
part of the Workshop Series "Basic Biostatistics and Bioinformatics". 

Todays lesson consists of two parts: a power point presentation introducing neural networks, and a notebook that contains the code that goes with the presentation. 

The code can be openes in Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) which requires a sign-in with a google account. 

Open the notebook in Colab and you can execute or change the existing code, or simply write your own code.
